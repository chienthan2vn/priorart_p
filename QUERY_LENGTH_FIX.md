# Query Length Optimization Fix

## Problem
The patent search query generation system was creating queries that were too long, causing search databases to return no results. This was due to lack of length constraints in the query generation prompt.

## Solution
Updated the `get_queries_prompt_and_parser()` method in `src/prompts/extraction_prompts.py` to include comprehensive length constraints and optimization guidelines.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Constraints Section
**Added new constraints:**
- Keep each query under 200 characters for database compatibility
- Limit to 8-10 keywords total per query
- Select only 2-3 most discriminative keywords per concept group
- Use abbreviated forms of long technical terms when appropriate
- Focus on core technical concepts rather than exhaustive keyword lists

**Enhanced existing constraints:**
- Emphasized effective but sparing use of Boolean operators
- Added guidance to avoid redundant or synonymous terms
- Prioritized technical specificity over comprehensive keyword inclusion

### 2. Enhanced Context Section
**Added Query Construction Guidelines:**
- Maximum query length: 200 characters per query
- Maximum keywords: 8-10 total terms per query
- Prioritize most discriminative technical terms from each concept group
- Use concise Boolean syntax: AND, OR, NOT
- Combine CPC codes efficiently (use OR between related codes)

**Added Strategy Examples:**
- Strategy 1 (Broad): `(term1 OR term2) AND (CPC1 OR CPC2)`
- Strategy 2 (Focused): `term1 AND term2 AND term3 AND CPC1`
- Strategy 3 (Proximity): `term1 NEAR term2 AND CPC1`

**Updated concept group instructions:**
- Added explicit guidance to "SELECT ONLY 2-3 MOST DISCRIMINATIVE TERMS FROM EACH"

### 3. Updated Instructions
**Added new step:**
- "Select the most discriminative and essential keywords from each concept group"
- "Ensure each query stays within optimal length limits for patent databases"

## Benefits

1. **Database Compatibility**: Queries now stay under 200 characters, ensuring compatibility with major patent databases
2. **Improved Precision**: Focus on most discriminative terms improves search relevance
3. **Reduced Noise**: Limiting keywords prevents overly broad searches
4. **Better Performance**: Shorter queries execute faster and return more relevant results
5. **Clear Guidelines**: Specific examples and constraints guide the AI to create optimal queries

## Testing
Created `test_query_length.py` to verify all improvements were successfully implemented:
- ✅ Character limit constraint (200 characters)
- ✅ Keyword selection guidance (2-3 per group)
- ✅ Maximum keyword limit (8-10 total)
- ✅ Construction guidelines included
- ✅ Example formats provided

## Usage
The updated prompt will automatically generate shorter, more focused queries when used in the patent search system. No changes needed to existing code that calls `ExtractionPrompts.get_queries_prompt_and_parser()`.

## Example Before/After

**Before (could exceed 300+ characters):**
```
(image recognition OR pattern detection OR classification accuracy OR feature detection OR object identification) AND (convolutional neural network OR deep learning model OR feature extraction OR neural architecture OR machine learning algorithm) AND (computer vision OR artificial intelligence OR medical imaging OR image processing OR pattern recognition) AND (G06N3/02 OR G06T7/00)
```

**After (under 200 characters):**
```
(image recognition OR classification) AND (convolutional OR deep learning) AND (computer vision OR AI) AND (G06N3/02 OR G06T7/00)
```

The optimized queries maintain technical precision while ensuring database compatibility and improved search performance.
